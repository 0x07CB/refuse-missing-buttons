# refuse-missing-buttons
missing auth buttons I need or see and if that set my mood bad... So I refuse that.

## To use I recommand place the shortcut thinked script to your `~/.local/bin/` and do not forgot change access execution rights for the script.

I have maybe other frustration to fix on this particular repos.


Peace,

I have made the decision to redirect MORE POEPLES TO THE BUTTON...

Note For next time I can:
 1) Redirections DNS of type CNAME
 2) I Place under ping the Hostinger without button and with button
 3) and I copy every day the results to compare if that contains the button...
